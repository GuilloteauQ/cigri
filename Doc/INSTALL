CONFIGURATION
=============

    1. Create a "cigri" user on the CIGRI server and each cluster frontal.

    2. Configure ssh connections between CIGRI server and each clusters:
        * create a set of ssh keys for the user "cigri" with ssh-keygen (for
          instance 'id_dsa.pub' and 'id_dsa')
        * append the contents of 'id_dsa.pub' to the file
          "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" on each cluster frontal
        * in "~/.ssh/config" on the CIGRI server add the lines:
            Host *
                ForwardX11 no
                StrictHostKeyChecking no
                PasswordAuthentication no
        * test ssh connections with (every) clusters; there should not
          be any prompt.

    3. Copy cvs repository of CIGRI in "cigri" user home.

    4. Copy the file 'Tools/cigri.conf' in '/etc' and edit it to suit your configuration.
       Be carefull, permissions must be "600" and this file must be owned by cigri user.

    5. Do a "chmod +s" on file 'Qfunctions/gridsub.pl' and 'Qfunctions/griddel.pl'.
       These scripts will be executed with cigri user id instead of real user one.
       (So these scripts will be allowed to read '/etc/cigri.conf')

    6. Create CIGRI database:
        mysql -uroot -p < DB/cigri_db.sql
       This file creates a user "cigri" and all tables in the database "cigri".

    7. Copy 'www2' directory in your web base repository (be carefull
       with right permissions).

    8. Edit '/etc/sudoers' and add lines:
        * on cigri server 
            
            cigri   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD : ALL
            
        * on each cluster frontal
            
            Runas_Alias     GRID = gridUser1, gridUser2, ...
            cigri   ALL=(GRID) NOPASSWD : ALL
          
          where gridUser* are grid user login name on the cluster.

FIRST STEPS
===========

    1. If you had set the tag "SSH_SERVER_PORT" with a right port value then
       launch the SSH server:
            Become cigri and launch 'Net/SSHcmdServer.pl'

    2. You can launch CIGRI:
            Become cigri and launch 'Almighty/AlmightyCigri.pl'

    3. Now you have to insert some informations in the database:
            * Clusters:
                Thanks to phpmyadmin, go to "clusters" table and insert
                every working clusters. Only clusterName field is needed.

            * Users:
                Go to "users" table and add each grid user with their
                cluster login (all fields are needed). Thus CIGRI system
                can know what is the login on a cluster for a grid user.

    4. In web interface, you have to go to "...../admin/index.php" URL; type on
       "connect" and change admin password. You can add an account for each grid
       user with a password ("Login" must be the same with "userGridName" in
       the users table).
