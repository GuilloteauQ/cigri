abstract={{M}onte {C}arlo simulations are nowadays widely used in the field of nuclear medicine. {T}hey are valuable for accurately reproducing experimental data, but at the expense of a long computing time. {A}n efficient solution for shorter elapsed time was recently proposed: grid computing. {T}he aim of this work is to validate a {M}onte {C}arlo simulation of the {B}iospace small animal \&\#947; {I}mager and to confirm the usefulness of grid computing for such a study. {S}imulated data obtained by the validated model of the gamma camera will enable to investigate new algorithms such as scatter and attenuation correction, and reconstruction methods. {G}ood matches between measured and simulated data were achieved and a crunching factor as high as 70 was achieved on a campus grid.},
