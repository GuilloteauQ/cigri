Advanced scheduler for the CiGri grid

1. **Introduction**

CiGri is a free software allowing to construct a computing grid
which exploits idle processor cycles of a supercomputers group.
CiGri is a lightweight grid which manages with only "bag-of-tasks"
applications that generaly result in a big number (>100000) of
independant and idempotent sub-tasks.
Running such applications at the grid level optimizes the load
of supercomputers in a middle sized HPC center.
Such a grid is running over HPC hosts of the Joseph Fourier
university (Grenoble/FRANCE) since 2002, inside the "CIMENT"
project. It manages today with 2000 cpu cores and executed about 
5 millions of tasks. The name CiGri comes originaly from this
CIMENT project (CIment-GRId). 
CiGri is also an experimental platform for research on distributed 
computing scheduling at the computing laboratory of Grenoble (LIG).


2. **Cigri structure**

CiGri is currently composed of a MySQL database, some perl modules
and some ruby modules. Communication and authentication mechanisms
are based on simple and standard tools like SSH, SUDO and LDAP.
A web PHP/Smarty interface allows users to check their job campaigns
statuses and to interact if necessary.
Everything has been developped and tested for Linux.
The modules are cyclicly executed: nodes and tasks states update,
tasks to submit scheduling, tasks launching, cleaning, error control,
statistics update. An external asynchronous module is dedicated to 
results collecting.

3. **Environnement**

Development is done inside the "MESCAL" team of the "LIG" laboratory
and guidelines are given by this team research projects and by
the exploit needs of the "CIMENT" project.
It's a motivating environnement because you can talk with engineers
and researchers working on complex problems about distributed 
computing. This "MESCAL" team is also in charge of the development
of the OAR resources manager and is a major actor of the development
and administration of the experimental french national grid called 
"Grid5000".

4. **The need for a new scheduler**

The current scheduler module of CiGri is a basic FIFO and doesn't
manage with parallel tasks. When the grid runs at a high load, it
may happen that a user is blocked for days, even if he needs
very few resources, for example if he only need to test a new
campaign. Furthermore, the Grenoble's grid is becoming biger and
extends to other towns (Lyon, for the RaGrid project). That brings
new needs like users priorities over some clusters, depending on 
their community.

We want to develop a new scheduler that will be able to manage
users fairsharing, several queues with complex priorities and
to take into account parallel tasks running on several nodes of a
cluster. This new scheduler should also manage interactions with 
other new modules that are also currently under development, like
a checkpointing module.
We want to use a high level modern language, like Ruby, to have
a very maintenable and scalable code.
In addition to this development task, the trainee, if he wants,
could approach more "system" aspects and participate to the
implementation of other tools like checkpointing or distributed
filesystems. Also note that this project is very close to the OAR 
project and Grid5000 administration.
