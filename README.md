# cigri
 CiGri is a lightweight grid middle-ware designed to run on top of a set of OAR (http://oar.imag.fr) clusters to manage efficiently large sets of multi-parametric tasks (also called bag-of-tasks).

With a powerful events handling, it manages automatic re-submission that is useful for best-effort jobs. With OAR and CIGRI, it is easy to reach 100% of usage efficiency on an heterogeneous grid in a local HPC center.

CiGri v3 is written in Ruby by CIMENT, the MESCAL team (from the LIG laboratory) and INRIA. It is released as a free software under the GPL.
